Drone uses Docker images for the build environment, for plugins and for service containers. The image field is exposed in the container blocks in the Yaml:

```diff
pipeline:
  build:
+   image: golang:1.6
    commands:
      - go build
      - go test

  publish:
+   image: plugins/docker
    repo: foo/bar

services:
  database:
+   image: mysql
```

Drone supports any valid Docker image from any Docker registry:

```text
image: golang
image: golang:1.7
image: library/golang:1.7
image: index.docker.io/library/golang
image: index.docker.io/library/golang:1.7
```

Drone does not automatically upgrade docker images. Example configuration to always pull the latest image when updates are available:

```diff
pipeline:
  build:
    image: golang:latest
+   pull: true
```
